## Project Results
In this project, the weather description was added to random location data that was previously generated. Then, based on input criteria, a subset of destinations was presented to the user. Hotels were then added to those potential travel destinations. A marker for each location was added to allow the user to see summary data for particular locations. Finally, I chose four locations in Indonesia and created a travel itinerary between the locations with summary marker map for each location.
